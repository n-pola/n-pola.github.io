							an der TH Köln galt es für das
							<a target="_blank" href="http://lucascranach.org/index.php"
								>Cranach Digital Archive</a
							>, ein Archiv für Werke von und aus dem Umkreis des Künstlers
							Lucas Cranach, eine Alternativ Ansicht für die Website zu
							gestalten.
						</p>
						<p>
							Voraussetzung für den neuen Entwurf war eine Darstellung, welche
							sowohl Experten als auch Laien eine einfache und präzise Bedienung
							bietet und neuen Nutzern die Inhalte angenehm darstellt. Weiterhin
							galt es unerfahrenen und neuen Nutzern einen möglichst
							explorativen Zugang zu den Werken von Luca Cranach zu ermöglichen.
						</p>
						<p>
							Zentrale Elemente der neuen Website sollten eine Form von
							Timeline, Cards zum Darstellen der Werke und diverse zusätzliche
							Features sein. Erforderlich war eine Hilfe, das Wechseln der
							Sprache, die Möglichkeit die Werke zu filtern und dies alles
							möglichst übersichtlich darzustellen. Des Weiteren haben wir uns
							dazu entschieden dem User die Möglichkeit zu geben sich über
							Neuigkeiten zu informieren und die Werke bezogen auf seinen
							aktuellen Standort zu sortieren.
						</p>
						<p>
							Zudem sollte der Entwurf der neuen Website für zwei verschiedenen
							Endgeräte erstellt werden.

							In mathematics, an ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal
							points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two
							distances to the focal points is a constant. As such, it
							generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in
							which the two focal points are the same.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ellipses are the closed type of conic section: a plane curve
							tracing the intersection of a cone with a plane. Ellipses have
							many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections,
							parabolas and hyperbolas, both of which are open and unbounded. An
							angled cross section of a cylinder is also an ellipse.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ellipses are common in physics, astronomy and engineering. For
							example, the orbit of each planet in the solar system is
							approximately an ellipse with the Sun at one focus point (more
							precisely, the focus is the barycenter of the Sun–planet pair).
							The same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems
							of two astronomical bodies. The shapes of planets and stars are
							often well described by ellipsoids. A circle viewed from a side
							angle looks like an ellipse: that is, the ellipse is the image of
							a circle under parallel or perspective projection. The ellipse is
							also the simplest Lissajous figure formed when the horizontal and
							vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency: a similar
							effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics.
